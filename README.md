MCPlas toolbox represents a collection of MATLAB functions for the automated generation of an equation-based fluid-Poisson model for non-thermal plasmas in the multiphysics simulation software COMSOL.
It aims at an easy and fast generation of models for the spatio-temporal modelling based on the input data containing all information about the considered species and reaction kinetic model. 
Following the development of the LXCat platform, all input data are prepared in a structured and interoperable JSON format and can be supplied and validated using existing JSON schemas. This supports the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles [33] in LTP research as well as the reproducibility of modelling results. A notable advantage of MCPlas over many commercial software packages lies in the transparent and direct access to all MATLAB source files, i.e. the specific model equations, boundary conditions and all input data.
